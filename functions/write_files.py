# functions/write_files.py
"""
Utility for writing a string to a file within a sandboxed directory.

The helper guarantees that the write target never escapes the supplied
``working_directory``.  It creates parent directories on demand and
returns a descriptive success or error message.

Usage
-----
>>> write_file("/tmp/sandbox", "sub/hello.txt", "world")
'SUCCESS: wrote to "sub/hello.txt" (5 characters written)'

If the target is outside the sandbox, the function returns an error string.

def write_file(
    working_directory: str, file_path: str, content: str
) -> str:
    """
    Write ``content`` to ``file_path`` relative to ``working_directory``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    working_directory : str
        Base directory that defines the sandbox.
    file_path : str
        Target file path (relative to ``working_directory``).
    content : str
        Data to be written.

    Returns
    -------
    str
        A message starting with ``SUCCESS:`` on success or ``Error:`` on
        failure.  The message includes the number of characters written.

    Notes
    -----
    * The function automatically creates missing parent directories.
    * All paths are resolved with :class:`pathlib.Path` to avoid issues
      with ``..`` traversal.
    * No exceptions are raised â€“ the caller should inspect the return
      string for errors.
